        <h1>What Should you Look out for in Website Design?</h1>
        <p>Adhering to the following tips is crucial for ensuring your website is usable by those with color blindness. You may look at your website and think that everything looks perfect, however, to someone with protanomaly the text may be difficult to parse through. This is why we follow color contrast guidelines!</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Text Readability</strong>
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <p>WCAG has specific guidelines related to this, and they read as follows: “*WCAG 2.0 level AA requires a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text (14 point and bold or larger, or 18 point or larger).*”</p>

                <p><strong>Overlaying Text on Background Images</strong>
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Having text on top of images can be challenging to read. Reducing the opacity of the background helps you remedy this issue in many cases.</p>

                <p><strong>Color Filters, Pickers, and Swatches</strong>
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Having colors labeled is very important for accessibility. For example, when buying clothes and picking between the various colors available, it is necessary that the names of the colors are listed with them, as otherwise it can be very difficult to differentiate between them</p>

                <p><strong>Useful Descriptions</strong>
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Ensure that your descriptions are clear and not ambiguous. For example, labeling a shirt as a “leafy color” could mean multiple colors, it is not clear.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>

                <p><strong>Link Recognition</strong>
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Links should be easy to identify without color, meaning they must stick out in some form. It is important that one does not rely on making text that links elsewhere blue (for example), and then making no other changes. Underlining text is a good backup option.</p>
