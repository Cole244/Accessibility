        <h1>What is Color Blindness?</h1>
        <p>There are many variations of color blindness, but all types relate in some form to the following: not being able to see colors clearly, getting them mixed up, or struggling to distinguish between certain colors.</p>
        <p>Approximately 3.7% of Americans are color blind. Typically color blindness affects men vastly more than it does women. 1 in 200 (0.5%) women are affected, while 1 in 12 (8%) men are affected. It is difficult to comprehend what color blindness is like without having experienced it, thus having it visualized to understand what we see versus what color blind people see is important.</p>

        <p><i>The three most common types are:</i>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Deuteranomaly</strong>: Affects 6% of men, causes a reduced ability to differentiate between red and green shades</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p><strong>Protan</strong>: Second most common, also causes a reduced ability to differentiate between red and green shades</p>

        </p>
        <p><strong>Tritanomaly</strong>: Much rarer form, makes it difficult to differentiate between yellow and blue shades, plus yellow and red</p>

        <p>With these comparisons, it is clear that what looks perfectly readable to someone who is not color blind may still not be accessible.</p>
        <p>This color blindness can be just as much of a nuisance when surfing the web as it is in regular day to day life. And it’s important to employ strategies to ensure your web content is readable and contrasts well for as many as possible.
