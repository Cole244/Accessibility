        <h1 style="font-family: Helvetica;">Types of Accessibility</h1>
        <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">Accessibility comes in different forms, and can fall under different design principals. Something being accessible, while still good, does not necessarily mean it is perfect.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">The main types are universal and accessible design. And while the distinction between the two may seem small it can be significant. Accessible design considers the needs of people with disabilities. Accessible design often entails you adding features to a previously established design. For example, adding a ramp or accessible entrance to a previously inaccessible building. Universal design focuses on making things that are usable for all. Instead of separate stairs and an offset ramp, for universal design you might move the actual entrance down so no elevation gain is necessary. This makes things simpler for everyone. In the following figure, example 1 represents accessible design while example two represents universal.</p>

        </p>
        <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">Example one undoubtedly works, and helps those with wheelchairs move easily into a potentially older building. However, example two showcases you can make newer designs that are accessible for all without the need for additions. Universal design treats those with disabilities in the same way it treats those without disabilities (as should you!). A combined set of stairs and a ramp is another example of this type of design, as well as larger ramps that can accommodate large groups of people (as pictured below). This design allows for everyone to move up floors together, without the need to separate people.  The line of thinking that has propelled it also shows in the digital world.</p>

        <h3>Universal Digital Design </h3>
        <p>Universal design is also prevalent in the digital space. You have probably encountered it yourself at some point! Here are some common examples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Adjustable font sizes</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Large buttons</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>High color contrast for text</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-style: normal;">All of these examples benefit not just those with disabilities, but also those without. It makes things easier for everyone, and you should be ensure to employ tactics such as these in your own content!</p>
