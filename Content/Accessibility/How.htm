        <h1 style="font-family: Helvetica;">How should we think about accessibility and why is it important?</h1>
        <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">Accessibility is key for making the world more available to everyone. Not only is it important, but it’s important how we think about it, and that we acknowledge that a large percentage of people have disabilities.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Helvetica;"><a href="https://media.abilitymagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/18120333/CDC-disability-impacts-all.jpg"><img src="../Resources/Images/CDC-disability-impacts-all.png" alt="Map of the United States showing that 26% of adults in the country have a disability" style="max-width: 84%;" /></a>
        </p>
        <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">With such a vast amount of the population affected and rising disability movements, the way we approach accessibility has begun to shift. There are multiple models of accessibility, with the medical and newer social models being the most widespread. In short, these are how they view disabilities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p style="font-family: Helvetica;font-weight: normal;">The Medical Model</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">Impairment is the problem</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">People are disabled by their impairments, which need to be fixed.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">The Social Model</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">Stairs are the problem</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">People are disabled by their environment, and it is the environment that needs to be fixed (ramps instead of stairs for example)</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">The medical model looks at the disability as the issue, which needs to be corrected or fixed through medical treatment/intervention. Accessibility, under this model, is typically seen as adapting an individual to fit into existing environments. </p>
        <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">However, the social model argues that design that does not accommodate for all as the problem. Its focus is on removing barriers in the world we live in, such as changing pre-existing designs that are less inclusive.The social model takes away from the sentiment of disabled people being the problem.</p>
