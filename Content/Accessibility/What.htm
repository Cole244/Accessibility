        <h1 style="font-family: Arial;">What is Accessibility?</h1>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;">Accessibility revolves around making content, activities, and events usable and enjoyable by as many people as possible. Typically, it refers to making such things easier for those with disabilities. One of the most recognizable forms of accessibility are physical ones such as installed ramps that help wheelchair users who can’t navigate stairs. Automatic doors and specialized cars may also be things you have come across. These inventions help make buildings and transportation more <i>accessible</i>. However, disabilities come in many different forms. There are many kinds of disabilities, as outlined below!</p>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;"><a href="https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/building-web-accessibility-barriers-guidelines-standards_01.jpg"><img src="../Resources/Images/building-web-accessibility-barriers-guidelines-standards_01.png" alt="The five kinds of disabilities displayed.

        </p>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;">All of these disabilities can lead to needing different accommodations.   These are also seen in the digital space; did you know that many websites have accessibility tools?</p>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;">As a content creator, you may have, but many do not! The features that help make the internet more accessible aren’t always things one without a disability would come across. But there are many! These kinds of features are necessary to help everyone access and enjoy content, and as a result there are guidelines that revolve around this. They’re known as the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-WCAG20-20060427/appendixB.html">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> (WCAG), and are set by the World Wide Web Consortium. If you're designing a professional website, you should know them! The extent to which a website adheres to these guidelines is shown through the WCAG:&#160;Levels of Conformance:</p>
        <ul style="font-family: Helvetica;">
            <li>
                <p style="font-family: Arial;">A - the most basic</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p style="font-family: Arial;">AA - what most businesses strive to meet</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p style="font-family: Arial;">AAA - aspirational (most difficult to implement; cannot be applied everywhere)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Following these guidelines is important, as it ensures as many people as possible can enjoy a website's content.</span>
        </p>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;">Examples of following these guidelines might include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p style="font-family: Arial;">Captions for audio content</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The page's language is specified</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Content can be viewed in multiple orientations (i.e. landscape or portrait)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
