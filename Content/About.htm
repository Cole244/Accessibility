        <p style="font-family: Arial;">Hello and welcome! My name is Cole Matinzi and I am a senior English major who's a part of the Commonwealth Honors College at UMass Amherst. I am set to complete the Professional Writing and Technical Communication (PWTC) Certificate this Spring. I am looking to work in a tech writing or tech writing adjacent role following graduation, and am excited to use the experience I have garnered in the PWTC program in a professional space. I have been a part of the program since the spring of my junior year, having completed the 5 course program across 3 different semesters.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;">Following my graduation, I aim to leverage my skills in various professional contexts, contributing effectively to my field and continuing to learn and grow within the industry. Feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cole-matinzi-b07129266/">LinkedIn</a>, or email me at cam32r@comcast.net</p>
