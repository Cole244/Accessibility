        <h1 style="font-family: Arial;">What is Alt Text?</h1>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Alt text (or alternative text) is a feature employed by website designers to help describe the visual content of an image. Designers add a brief piece of text that explains an image which allows people with visual impairments to still understand the purpose of an image while not being able to see it. The text is read to them by software's called "screen readers." Your alt text should be kept brief, ideally less than 150 characters, and should avoid restating already available information. For example, screen readers can identify the presence of an image, and thus starting alt text with "An image of..." is redundant. It is incredibly important that you add it to your digital content, as it makes the website easier to understand by all.</span>

        <p style="font-family: Arial;">Alt text is important because it allows those with visual impairments to experience content of a web page that would otherwise be unavailable to them. With this in mind, it is especially important that you write alt text correctly so that their experience is a complete one. Use the following tips to help you in the process!</p>

        </h3>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;">If we look at the <span class="cross-reference"><a href="#Image">example image</a></span> above, the user is attempting to write alt text to describe a picture of pizza. At a glance it seems to do its job, but if you re-read it then it's clear this is bad alt text. There is actually one slice of pizza missing, instead of one slice on the plate. It does not describe the image properly, giving a misleading interpretation of it. When writing good alt text, we want to ensure we describe the image accurately, while being concise. For example, "A&#160;black and white pizza on a tray with one slice missing." This provides a relatively short, but informative explanation of the image that is most importantly true. Other common mistakes when it comes to writing alt text is keeping things too short, or leaving out details. For example, "Pizza" or "Pizza on a plate," while accurate, lack the extra context provided in the image, and are bad pieces of alt text as a result.</p>
